# rpi-image-gen-trial

This repository was created with the help of the <https://github.com/jonnymacs/rpi-image-gen-example> repository. I have added some customizations and minor updates.

## Running

1. Clone the project.
2. Update the `RPI_***` parameter in the `build.sh` file.
3. Run `./build.sh` in the root directory of the project.
4. If everything is successful, the image will appear in the `deploy/` directory.
